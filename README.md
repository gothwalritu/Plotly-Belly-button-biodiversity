# Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

# Overview and Objective:

In this module we are creating a webpage to display the results of a research project. This project was called as “belly button biodiversity project”. the diversity of bacterial species in the belly buttons of the humans has been studied and documented. The sample were collected from the volunteers. This webpage presents a dashboard that shows the demographic information for each volunteer and also shows the graphical presentation of the top ten bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
I customized the dashboard by adding an image in background using jumbotron, made this page mobile responsive and added other elements to improve the aesthetics of the webpage. The dashboard is interactive and could be used to display any selected sample. It shows one bar chart, one gauge chat and one bubble chart.

## Resources:

**•	JavaScript**

**•	Plotly**

**•	D3.js**

The below screenshot is how this dashboard looks.
